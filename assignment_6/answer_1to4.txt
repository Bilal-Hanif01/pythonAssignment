Question 1:
    Define Object Oriented Programming Language?


Answer  1:
Object Oriented Programming language (OPPs): 
=}  Object Object Programming Language is a very common Programming  Paradig(style of designing software) that implements objects and their associated procedures within the programming context to create software programs.

Answer 2:
=} Makes software design easy.
=} Data is safe and secure.
=} Easy to share.
=} Code is reusable.

Question 3:
    Differentiate between function and method?

Answer 3:

Function:
=}  A function is a block of code to carry out a specific task, will contain its own scope and is called by name. All functions may contain zero(no) arguments or more than one arguments. On exit, a function can or can not return one or more values.

Method:
=}  A method in python is somewhat similar to a function, except it is associated with object/classes. Methods in python are very similar to functions except for two major differences.

1) The method is implicitly used for an object for which it is called.
2) The method is accessible to data that is contained within the class.

Question 4:
    Define the following terms:

Class:
=}  A class is a blueprint for how an object is built, as well as being a sort of “parent category” for objects. For example, a class dictates the concept of a car—four wheels, an engine, a body, brakes, etc.

Object:
=}  An object is the core unit of OOP. Objects are uniquely named and represent an instance of a class. Each object houses different states (attributes), and shared behaviors, called methods. For example, a Prius is an object in the class of “cars”.

Attribute:
=}  Attributes are data stored inside a class or instance and represent the state or quality of the class or 
instance. In short, attributes store information about the instance. Also, attributes should not be confused with class functions also known as methods. 

Behavior
=}  The behavior of an object is defined by its methods, which are the functions and subroutines defined within the object class. Without class methods, a class would simply be a structure.
